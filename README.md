# Awooo

Awooo is C# WPF program based on gif I have seen online.

## Antivirus

Your antivirus program may recognize it as a virus because it is opening multiple windows at a same time (happened to friend). If it happens to multiple people, I will try to fix it.

## Running

Download and run `Awooo/bin/Release/Awooo.exe`
